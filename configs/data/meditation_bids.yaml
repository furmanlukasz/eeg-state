# Preprocessing (based on original paper methodology)
preprocessing:
  # Filtering - paper used 2 Hz high-pass
  filter_low: 2.0
  filter_high: 48.0
  notch_freq: 50.0  # EU line frequency

  # Referencing
  reference: "average"

  # Chunking - paper used 10s epochs before probes
  # For continuous analysis, we can use 5s chunks
  chunk_duration: 5.0
