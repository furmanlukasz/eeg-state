# Greek dataset configuration - All 3 groups, balanced
# MCI + HC + AD with equal number of subjects per group
#
# Use with: python -m eeg_biomarkers.training.train data=greek_all_balanced

dataset: "greek_resting"

# Data paths - all three groups
groups:
  - name: "HC"
    label: 0
    path: "HID/FILT"
  - name: "MCI"
    label: 1
    path: "MCI/FILT"
  - name: "AD"

# Sampling - BALANCED: use smallest group size for all
# AD typically has fewest subjects, so all groups will match AD count
