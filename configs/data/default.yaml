groups:
  - name: "MCI"
    path: "MCI"
  - name: "HC"
    path: "HID"  # Healthy controls folder name in legacy data
  # - name: "AD"  # Uncomment if using AD data
  #   path: "AD"

# Preprocessing
preprocessing:
  # Filtering
  filter_low: 3.0  # Hz
  filter_high: 48.0  # Hz
  notch_freq: null  # Set to 50 or 60 for line noise removal

  # Referencing
  reference: "csd"  # "csd" (current source density) or "average"

  # Chunking
  chunk_duration: 5.0  # seconds
  chunk_overlap: 0.0  # seconds (0 = no overlap)

  # Phase extraction
  phase_method: "hilbert"  # Only hilbert supported currently

# Sampling
sampling:
  n_subjects_per_group: null  # null = use all subjects
  random_seed: 42

# Splitting
splitting:
  method: "group_kfold"  # "group_kfold" or "stratified_kfold"
  n_splits: 5
  test_size: 0.2  # For single train/test split
  group_by: "subject"  # Prevents segment-level leakage

# Caching
caching:
  enabled: true
