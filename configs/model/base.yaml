# Base model configuration
name: "convlstm_autoencoder"

encoder:
  complexity: 2  # 0-3, controls network depth
  hidden_size: 64
  num_lstm_layers: 1
  dropout: 0.1

decoder:
  # Mirrors encoder by default
  use_encoder_config: true
  constrain_output: true  # Apply tanh to cos/sin outputs to keep in [-1, 1]

# Recurrence matrix settings
recurrence:
  # Use RR-controlled thresholding (recommended)
  threshold_method: "rr_controlled"  # "rr_controlled" or "fixed"
  target_rr: 0.02  # Target recurrence rate (2%)
  fixed_epsilon: null  # Only used if threshold_method is "fixed"

# Phase representation (CRITICAL: use circular)
phase:
  representation: "circular"  # "circular" (cos, sin) or "raw" (legacy, not recommended)
  include_amplitude: false  # Whether to include log-amplitude as additional channel
  normalize_amplitude: true  # Z-score normalize log-amplitude per channel (recommended)
                             # This prevents amplitude from dominating the reconstruction loss
